# Plot.ly Homework - Belly Button Biodiversity

![Bacteria by filterforge.com](Images/bacteria.jpg)

This assignment included building an interactive dashboard using Plotly to explore Belly Button Biodiversity, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

## The dashboard included the following visuals and programs:

1. The use of a D3 library to read in `samples.json`.

2. The creation of a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.

3. The creation of a bubble chart that displays each sample.

4. Creation of a display field to show individual's demographic information.

6. Ensure that all of the plots update any time a new sample is selected.

## Advanced Challenge Assignment (Optional)

The following task is advanced and therefore optional.

* Adapt the Gauge Chart from <https://plot.ly/javascript/gauge-charts/> to plot the weekly washing frequency of the individual.

* You will need to modify the example gauge code to account for values ranging from 0 through 9.

* Update the chart whenever a new sample is selected.

## Deployment

* Deploy your app to GitHub Pages. Submit the links to your deployment and your GitHub repo.

* Ensure your repository has regular commits (i.e. 20+ commits) and a thorough README.md file
